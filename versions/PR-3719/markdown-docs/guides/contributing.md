# Contributing

This is the documentation for Lime Elements. Documentation is generated by 
[Kompendium](https://kompendium.dev) and is written in Markdown

## Adding a new page in the docs

A new page can be added just by creating a new `.md` file anywhere in the project
and adding it to the `guides.ts` file.

```
# Hello world

I'm a markdown document that can have components!
```

## Include an example

There are two ways to include an example

* By adding a `@exampleComponent` tag to the doc block of the owning component
* Adding the HTML-tag for the component anywhere in a markdown document

### Using the @exampleComponent tag

By using the `@exampleComponent` tag the component gets inserted automatically for the owning component together with all code for the example, e.g

```tsx
/**
 * @exampleComponent my-component-example
 */
@Component({
    tag: 'my-component',
    shadow: true,
})
export class MyComponent {

}
```

### Adding a component to a markdown document

Any component can be included in the markdown document

The following file

```
# Hello world

This is my example file

<limel-example-button-group/>
```

will generate the following

<limel-example-button-group />
