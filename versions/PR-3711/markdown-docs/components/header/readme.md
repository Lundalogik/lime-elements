## Overview

A header is the top most visual element in a component, page, card, or a view.

## Usage
A header is the first thing that clarifies a context for users.
Due to their positions in the UI hierarchy, headers are the most
prominent elements of a user interface; and because of that, they carry both
vital information and fundamental controls for the area of the interface
they represent.

For example, when a header is placed on top of a card, it should quickly
explain the card to the user. When placed on top of a modal, it should easily
clarify what the modal is about. When displayed on top of a fullscreen view,
it should indicate where in the system users are, and what part of the app
they are looking at.


## Layout
The vital information in a header is usually manifested in form of an icon,
and a heading. A subheading also could be added to provide supplementary
information. There is also a third place for displaying supplementary information
or "supporting text", which will be rendered as a part of the subheading.
Along with this information, headers can also include actions, controls, or
menus.

:::important
Such actions or menus must affect the entire section of the interface
which the header is representing. For example, a _Delete_ button on a card
header must delete that entire card and its respective contents all together,
not for example a selected item which is visible in the content of that card.
:::


:::warning
Do not user background color on icons in the headers. It is much better and
much easier for the eye if your icon itself has a color.
Background colors behind icons make them look like "call to action" buttons
and take a lot of attention from users.
