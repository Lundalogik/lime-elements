## Overview

A Breadcrumb consists of a list of distinct "places" that a user has gone through,
before ending up where they are right now, in a website or an application.

These "places" can be for example _pages_ of a website, which are hierarchically
laid out before the current page that the user is looking at.
They could also be _steps_ which the user has gone through, which perhaps have no
hierarchical relation with each other, but has eventually led the user "here".

:::note
- Where the user currently is, is always the last step of the breadcrumb.
- A breadcrumbs never shows where users can go after this place.
It only illustrates where user has been before ending up here.
If the path that a user can take is not changing and if next steps are clear,
you can use the [Progress flow component](#/component/limel-progress-flow) instead.
:::

Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally before the main content of the current screen.
