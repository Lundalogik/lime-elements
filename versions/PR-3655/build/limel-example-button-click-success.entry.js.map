When the button is clicked, the `loading` attribute is set to `true`.\n * After a short while, we pretend that the saving was successful, and set\n * `loading` to `false`. We also set `disabled` to `true`, because we just\n * successfully saved, so until the user updates our imaginary form again, there\n * is nothing to save.\n *\n * When the `loading` attribute changes from `true` to `false`, the button\n * automatically displays a checkmark icon for 2 seconds. Note that our click\n * handler isn't actually involved in this.\n *\n * A short while after the checkmark has disappeared, we enable the button\n * again. This is just so that you can try the functionality again. Normally,\n * the button would stay disabled until the user made some changes, so there's\n * something new to save!\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-button-click-success',\n    shadow: true,\n})\nexport class ButtonClickSuccessExample {\n    @State()\n    private loading = false;\n\n    @State()\n    private disabled = false;\n\n    public render() {\n        return (\n            <limel-button\n                label=\"Click me!\"\n                primary={true}\n                loading={this.loading}\n                disabled={this.disabled}\n                onClick={this.onClick}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n\n    private onClick() {\n        this.loading = true;\n\n        const TIME_LOADING = 1000;\n        const TIME_DISABLED = 5000;\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            this.loading = false;\n            this.disabled = true;\n            setTimeout(() => {\n                this.disabled = false;\n            }, TIME_DISABLED);\n        }, TIME_LOADING);\n    }\n}\n"],"mappings":"qDAyBaA,EAAyB,MAJtC,WAAAC,CAAAC,G,UAMYC,KAAOC,QAAG,MAGVD,KAAQE,SAAG,KA2BtB,CAzBU,MAAAC,GACH,OACIC,EAAA,gBAAAC,IAAA,2CACIC,MAAM,YACNC,QAAS,KACTN,QAASD,KAAKC,QACdC,SAAUF,KAAKE,SACfM,QAASR,KAAKQ,S,CAKlB,OAAAA,GACJR,KAAKC,QAAU,KAEf,MAAMQ,EAAe,IACrB,MAAMC,EAAgB,IACtBC,YAAW,KACPX,KAAKC,QAAU,MACfD,KAAKE,SAAW,KAChBS,YAAW,KACPX,KAAKE,SAAW,KAAK,GACtBQ,EAAc,GAClBD,E","ignoreList":[]}
