Depending on the context,\n * It might also be a good idea to include the accessible label for sighted\n * users as well, for instance, as a heading.\n * - `accessibleItemsLabel`: Will be used as a `th` for the first column of the table,\n * describing what all items in this column have in common. In this example,\n * all items are cities. When not provided, it will default to the translation\n * for \"items\" in the current language.\n * - `accessibleValuesLabel`: Will be used as a `th` for the second column of the table,\n * describing what all values in this column have in common. In this example,\n * all values are temperatures. When not provided, it will default to the translation\n * for \"value\" in the current language.\n *\n * Note that these props won't be visually rendered for sighted users, but\n * they will be presented to assistive technologies, such as screen readers\n * as well as search engines.\n *\n * Another way to improve the accessibility of the chart is to use\n * the `prefix` and `suffix` props to provide additional context to the `value`\n * of each item.\n *\n * ##### Using the `loading` prop\n * Sometimes the data set needs to be calculated, or fetched\n * through a process that requires some time. In such cases, it is\n * a great idea to let the users know that the data is being updated.\n *\n * To do so, set the `loading` property to `true`. The component will then\n * show a spinner, indicating the data is being updated. This not only improves\n * the user experience, but also the accessibility of the chart both for sighted users,\n * and behind the scenes, for users of assistive technologies.\n *\n * @sourceFile chart-items-gantt-negative-values.ts\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-chart-accessibility',\n    shadow: true,\n    styleUrl: 'chart-examples.scss',\n})\nexport class ChartAccessibilityExample {\n    @State()\n    public loading = false;\n\n    public render() {\n        const heading = 'Temperature fluctuations past 24 hours';\n        const subHeading = 'in cities we have our offices';\n\n        return (\n            <Host class=\"large\">\n                <limel-header\n                    heading={heading}\n                    subheading={subHeading}\n                    icon=\"temperature_sensitive\"\n                />\n                <limel-chart\n                    type=\"bar\"\n                    items={chartItems}\n                    orientation=\"landscape\"\n                    accessibleLabel={`${heading} - ${subHeading}`}\n                    accessibleValuesLabel=\"Temperature in Celsius\"\n                    accessibleItemsLabel=\"City\"\n                    loading={this.loading}\n                />\n                <limel-example-controls>\n                    <limel-checkbox\n                        label=\"Loading\"\n                        checked={this.loading}\n                        onChange={this.setLoading}\n                    />\n                </limel-example-controls>\n            </Host>\n        );\n    }\n\n    private setLoading = (event: CustomEvent<boolean>) => {\n        event.stopPropagation();\n        this.loading = event.detail;\n    };\n}\n"],"mappings":"qIAAA,MAAMA,EAAmB,qvB,MCgDZC,EAAyB,MALtC,WAAAC,CAAAC,G,UAOWC,KAAOC,QAAG,MAiCTD,KAAAE,WAAcC,IAClBA,EAAMC,kBACNJ,KAAKC,QAAUE,EAAME,MAAM,CAElC,CAnCU,MAAAC,GACH,MAAMC,EAAU,yCAChB,MAAMC,EAAa,gCAEnB,OACIC,EAACC,EAAK,CAAAC,IAAA,2CAAAC,MAAM,SACRH,EACI,gBAAAE,IAAA,2CAAAJ,QAASA,EACTM,WAAYL,EACZM,KAAK,0BAETL,EAAA,eAAAE,IAAA,2CACII,KAAK,MACLC,MAAOC,EACPC,YAAY,YACZC,gBAAiB,GAAGZ,OAAaC,IACjCY,sBAAsB,yBACtBC,qBAAqB,OACrBpB,QAASD,KAAKC,UAElBQ,EAAA,0BAAAE,IAAA,4CACIF,EAAA,kBAAAE,IAAA,2CACIW,MAAM,UACNC,QAASvB,KAAKC,QACduB,SAAUxB,KAAKE,c","ignoreList":[]}
