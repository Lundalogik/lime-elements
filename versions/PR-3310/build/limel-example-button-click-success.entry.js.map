When the button is clicked, the `loading` attribute is set to `true`.\n * After a short while, we pretend that the saving was successful, and set\n * `loading` to `false`. We also set `disabled` to `true`, because we just\n * successfully saved, so until the user updates our imaginary form again, there\n * is nothing to save.\n *\n * When the `loading` attribute changes from `true` to `false`, the button\n * automatically displays a checkmark icon for 2 seconds. Note that our click\n * handler isn't actually involved in this.\n *\n * A short while after the checkmark has disappeared, we enable the button\n * again. This is just so that you can try the functionality again. Normally,\n * the button would stay disabled until the user made some changes, so there's\n * something new to save!\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-button-click-success',\n    shadow: true,\n})\nexport class ButtonClickSuccessExample {\n    @State()\n    private loading = false;\n\n    @State()\n    private disabled = false;\n\n    public render() {\n        return (\n            <limel-button\n                label=\"Click me!\"\n                primary={true}\n                loading={this.loading}\n                disabled={this.disabled}\n                onClick={this.onClick}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n\n    private onClick() {\n        this.loading = true;\n\n        const TIME_LOADING = 1000;\n        const TIME_DISABLED = 5000;\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            this.loading = false;\n            this.disabled = true;\n            setTimeout(() => {\n                this.disabled = false;\n            }, TIME_DISABLED);\n        }, TIME_LOADING);\n    }\n}\n"],"mappings":"qDAyBaA,EAAyB,M,sCAEhB,M,cAGC,K,CAEZC,SACH,OACIC,EAAA,gBACIC,MAAM,YACNC,QAAS,KACTC,QAASC,KAAKD,QACdE,SAAUD,KAAKC,SACfC,QAASF,KAAKE,S,CAKlBA,UACJF,KAAKD,QAAU,KAEf,MAAMI,EAAe,IACrB,MAAMC,EAAgB,IACtBC,YAAW,KACPL,KAAKD,QAAU,MACfC,KAAKC,SAAW,KAChBI,YAAW,KACPL,KAAKC,SAAW,KAAK,GACtBG,EAAc,GAClBD,E"}
