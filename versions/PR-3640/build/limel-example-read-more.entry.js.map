Proactive help is intended to get users familiar with an interface while reactive help is meant for troubleshooting and gaining system proficiency.\n\n#### Intro\n\nWebsites and applications can offer two types of help: _proactive_ and _reactive_.\n\n- **Proactive help** is provided before the user has encountered a problem, in order to prevent issues. It includes [onboarding tutorials](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-app-onboarding/) and contextual tips.\n- **Reactive help** in contrast includes materials such as documentation, videos, or even tutorials for those situations when users have an issue and they seek out advice to address it. (Even though some users may consume such materials proactively, it is rare that they do so.)\n`;\n\nexport const link = {\n    href: 'https://www.nngroup.com/articles/help-and-documentation/',\n    title: 'Opens in a new window',\n    target: '_blank',\n    text: 'Read more...',\n};\n","import { Component, h } from '@stencil/core';\nimport { helpAndDocumentation, link } from './help-and-documentation';\n\n/**\n * Help with the read more link\n * If a `readMoreLink` supplied, it will render a \"Read more\" link at the bottom of the content.\n *\n * Even though you can add a link anywhere in the content, it is recommended to\n * use the read more link.
