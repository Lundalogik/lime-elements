This means users will only see one line of text which is as wides as\n * the list item, and no more.

By default, lists will display 3 lines of text, and then truncate\n * the rest. Nevertheless, you can increase or decrease this number by specifying\n * `maxLinesSecondaryText`.\n * :::note\n * Do not use `0`, negative numbers, decimal numbers, or very large numbers.\n * :::\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-list-badge-icons-with-multiple-lines',\n    shadow: true,\n})\nexport class BadgeIconsListExample {\n    private items: Array<ListItem<number>> = [\n        {\n            text: 'This item only has one line of primary text, and no secondary text',\n            value: 1,\n            icon: 'text_width',\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Very long primary texts like this one will truncate and you cannot do anything about it.
