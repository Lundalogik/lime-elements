# Switch vs. Checkbox

A checkbox and a switch both control binary options like On/Off
or Enable/Disable. They are very similar in that sense, and many
developers use them interchangeably.

However, there is a difference between these two components when
it comes to usability and interaction design!

The rule of thumb is to use a <b>Switch</b>, whenever toggling
the setting is instantly applied and does not required further
explicit actions from the user. And use a <b>Checkbox</b> when
the user has to confirm their choices for them to take effect.
