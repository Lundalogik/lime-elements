Depending on the context,\n * It might also be a good idea to include the accessible label for sighted\n * users as well, for instance, as a heading.\n * - `accessibleItemsLabel`: Will be used as a `th` for the first column of the table,\n * describing what all items in this column have in common. In this example,\n * all items are cities.\n *\n * Note that these props won't be visually rendered for sighted users, but\n * they will be presented to assistive technologies, such as screen readers\n * as well as search engines.\n *\n * Another way to improve the accessibility of the chart is to use\n * the `prefix` and `suffix` props to provide additional context to the `value`\n * of each item.\n *\n * @sourceFile chart-items-gantt-negative-values.ts\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-chart-accessibility',\n    shadow: true,\n    styleUrl: 'chart-examples.scss',\n})\nexport class ChartAccessibilityExample {\n    public render() {\n        const heading = 'Temperature fluctuations past 24 hours';\n        const subHeading = 'in cities we have our offices';\n\n        return (\n            <Host class=\"large\">\n                <limel-header\n                    heading={heading}\n                    subheading={subHeading}\n                    icon=\"temperature_sensitive\"\n                />\n                <limel-chart\n                    type=\"bar\"\n                    items={chartItems}\n                    orientation=\"landscape\"\n                    accessibleLabel={`${heading} - ${subHeading}`}\n                    accessibleItemsLabel=\"City\"\n                />\n            </Host>\n        );\n    }\n}\n"],"mappings":"qIAAA,MAAMA,EAAmB,owB,MCiCZC,EAAyB,M,yBAC3BC,SACH,MAAMC,EAAU,yCAChB,MAAMC,EAAa,gCAEnB,OACIC,EAACC,EAAI,CAACC,MAAM,SACRF,EAAA,gBACIF,QAASA,EACTK,WAAYJ,EACZK,KAAK,0BAETJ,EAAA,eACIK,KAAK,MACLC,MAAOC,EACPC,YAAY,YACZC,gBAAiB,GAAGX,OAAaC,IACjCW,qBAAqB,S"}
