This gives the users the possibility of interacting with links\n * in a natural way, for instance they can open any of the previous\n * pages in a new browser tab. This also has other accessibility benefits.\n *\n * :::note\n * Clicking links will open in current window by default,\n * and this reloads the entire webpage.\n * To avoid reloading the whole application (in the context of a single-page apps),\n * you might want to handle the navigation with your application's router,\n * :::\n *\n * Keep in mind that the last item will not be rendered as an HTML link and\n * is not clickable.\n */\n@Component({\n    tag: 'limel-example-breadcrumbs-links',\n    shadow: true,\n})\nexport class BreadcrumbsLinksExample {\n    private items: BreadcrumbsItem[] = [\n        {\n            text: 'Home',\n            link: {\n                href: '../../../..',\n                title: 'Start',\n            },\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Products',\n            link: {\n                href: '../../../',\n                title: 'See all of our products',\n            },\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Phones',\n            link: {\n                href: '../../',\n            },\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Accessories',\n            link: {\n                href: '../',\n            },\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Earphones',\n        },\n    ];\n\n    public render() {\n        return <limel-breadcrumbs items={this.items} />;\n    }\n}\n"],"mappings":"qDA4BaA,EAAuB,MAJpCC,YAAAC,G,UAKYC,KAAAC,MAA2B,CAC/B,CACIC,KAAM,OACNC,KAAM,CACFC,KAAM,cACNC,MAAO,UAGf,CACIH,KAAM,WACNC,KAAM,CACFC,KAAM,YACNC,MAAO,4BAGf,CACIH,KAAM,SACNC,KAAM,CACFC,KAAM,WAGd,CACIF,KAAM,cACNC,KAAM,CACFC,KAAM,QAGd,CACIF,KAAM,a,CAIPI,SACH,OAAOC,EAAA,qBAAmBN,MAAOD,KAAKC,O"}
