# limel-example-code-editor-readonly-with-line-numbers



<!-- Auto Generated Below -->


## Overview

Readonly, with line numbers and dark theme
Here you see a `readonly` instance of the Code Editor component. This means
you cannot edit the code. We also display line numbers here.
Additionally, this instance has a `dark` `colorScheme`, which means it does not
respect the operating system's settings for preferred appearance (dark or light).
