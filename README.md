## Quick Start

```html
<!-- Load the package -->
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@limetech/lime-elements@latest/dist/lime-elements/lime-elements.esm.js"></script>

<!-- Use components in your HTML -->
<limel-input-field
    label="Name"
    placeholder="Enter your full name"

## Getting Started

- To install, run `npm install @limetech/lime-elements`.

### Requirements

#### 1. Font

To achieve a blazing fast rendering, our components' user interface utilizes a default cross-browser sans-serif font stack. As web components typically inherit font-related styles such as `font-family`, `font-size`, and `color`, we recommend defining these styles at a higher level, such as the `<body>` element. This is because we do not specify these defaults on each individual component.

To maintain consistency with the look & feel demonstrated in this documentation, we suggest incorporating the following styles into your project:

```css
font-family: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
font-size: 0.875rem;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 400;
color: rgb(var(--contrast-1500));
```

üí° About the `color` specified above, read more on [our color system](/#/DesignGuidelines/color-system.md/).

Feel free to customize the font-family and related styles to suit your project's needs. For example, you might prefer a different typeface like below:

```css
font-family: 'Roboto', Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
```

#### 2. Icons

At Lime, we utilize the [_Windows 11 Outline_ icon set from **Icons8**](https://icons8.com/icons/fluency-systems-regular). You may notice these icons in our components, such as the magnifying glass icon displayed as a leading icon on an input field.

If you're using Lime Elements in a non-Lime product, you'll need to provide your own icons. We're unable to redistribute Icons8's assets with our package due to licensing restrictions.

Providing your own icons is crucial as many of our components use an `Icon` interface. This interface allows you to specify an icon name, which corresponds to the filename of an SVG icon. For example, you can use this to display an icon on a button.

##### How to Set Up Your Icons Folder

- **For _Lime_ products:**

    To use `@lundalogik/lime-icons8`, the `/assets` folder from `@lundalogik/lime-icons8` must be made available on the web-server.

- **For _non-Lime_ products:**

    To use a different icon set, the icons must be placed in a folder structure that looks like this: `assets/icons/<name-of-icon>.svg`

    If `assets` is placed in the root, no other setup is needed. The icons will be fetched with a relative URL from `/assets/icons/<name-of-icon>.svg`.

    If `assets` is placed in a sub-folder somewhere, the easiest way to make the icons available is to use the HTML `base` element:

    ```html
    <base href="/my/parent/path/" />
    ```

    If this is not enough, or if the `base` element is already in use for something else, a global icon path can be configured with the `limel-config` element:

    ```ts
    <limel-config config={{iconPath: '/my/parent/path/'}} />
    ```

## Using @beta Components

Components marked as `@beta` are not yet stable. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Breaking changes:** We may change `@beta` components in ways that break your code. We won't increase the major version number when we do this.
1. **Unstable:** `@beta` components may have more bugs than other components. Use them at your own risk.
1. **Feedback wanted:** We offer `@beta` components to get your input. Your feedback helps us improve them.

Remember: All components can change, but `@beta` components change more often and without warning.
