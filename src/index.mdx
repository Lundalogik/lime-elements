# Lime Elements

Version [<version>](https://github.com/Lundalogik/lime-elements/blob/v<version>/CHANGELOG.md). Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/Lundalogik/lime-elements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for information about all versions.

This is the documentation for Lime Elements. Under *Components*, you will find documentation for each available component, along with examples of use.

## Colors

It's possible to change the color of many components by setting custom CSS properties. They can be defined on any element, and will affect all descendants of that element.

The properties that can be set are the following:

| Name                       | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| --lime-primary-color       | Primary color                                         |
| --lime-secondary-color     | Secondary color (only used by a few elements)         |
| --lime-on-primary-color    | Text/icon color to use on primary color               |
| --lime-on-secondary-color  | Text/icon color to use on secondary color             |


### Lime Color Palette

There are also custom CSS properties defined for a few colors that can be used anywhere, even on elements that are not part of Lime Elements!

<limel-example-color-table />
