# Lime Elements

This is the documentation for Lime Elements. Documentation is generated by Docz and
is written in MDX (Markdown + JSX)

## Adding a new page in the docs

A new page can be added just by creating a new `.mdx` file anywhere in the project

```
---
name: Hello world
route: /hello-world
menu: Components
---

# Hello world

I'm a markdown document that can have components!
```

## Include an example

There are two ways to include an example

* Using the built in `Playground` component
* Using the custom `limel-example` element

### Using the Playground component

By using the `Playground` component, the example can be written inline inside the `.mdx`
file. The following file

```
---
name: Hello world
---

import { Playground } from 'docz'

# Hello world

This is my example file

<Playground>
    <limel-button primary label="My button" />
</Playground>
```

will generate the following example

<Playground>
    <limel-button primary label="My button" />
</Playground>

### Using the limel-example element

By using the `limel-example` element, examples can be written in their own example
files and referenced in the docs.

The following file

```
---
name: Hello world
---

# Hello world

This is my example file

<limel-example name="limel-example-button"/>
```

will generate the following example

<limel-example name="limel-example-button"/>

At the moment, for this to work the examples must be placed in `/src/examples/<type>` and
follow the same nameing convention as the existing examples
