# Events and input handling

All components in Lime Elements that take some kind of input and has a value does so via the `value` property. When the value of the component is changed, e.g. from typing in a field or clicking in a checkbox, a `change` event is dispatched from the component with the new value. This means that the `value` property is *not* updated automatically and it's the responsibility of the consumer to set the new value, like in the example below.

## Custom events

All events that are declared in these documents are of the type [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent), which has a `detail` property that may contain more information regarding the event. The type of the detail property is defined in these documents and can be used in the event handler to make the code more readable.

## DOM events

Besides the custom events that are defined in these documents, it is also possible to listen for any standard DOM event, e.g. `click`. These events does not have the `detail` property and how to use them are not described within this doumentation.

## Example

```tsx
class MyComponent {    
    @State()
    private value: string;

    public render() {
        return [
            <limel-input-field value={this.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />,
            <limel-button label="Submit" onClick={this.handleClick} />
        ];
    }

    private handleChange = (event: CustomEvent<string>) => {
        this.value = event.detail;
    }

    private handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) => {
        console.log(this.value);
    }
}
```
