# Modes
Dark Mode and Light Mode are supported by Lime Elements to have a more inclusive design; provide a broader accessibility support, and give possibility to users to choose their preferred styles.

By using our CSS variables for colors, shadows, etc..., our components, and generic CSS class conventions you can make sure that dark/light modes are automatically handled thanks to `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature.
