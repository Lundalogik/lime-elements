# Colors

It's possible to change the color of the elements by setting custom CSS properties, either globally on an element, like
`body` or `html`, or locally on a single element.

The properties that can be set are the following

| Name                       | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| --lime-primary-color       | Primary color                                         |
| --lime-secondary-color     | Secondary color (only used by a few elements)         |
| --lime-on-primary-color    | Text/icon color to use on primary color               |
| --lime-on-secondary-color  | Text/icon color to use on secondary color             |


## Lime color palette 

There are also custom CSS properties defined for a few colors that can be used anywhere, even on elements that are not 
part of Lime Elements!

<limel-example-color-table />

## Example

<limel-example name="limel-example-color" />
