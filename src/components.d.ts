     * Button groups are often used to display different views of the same thing. A
     * common example of this component is when you switch between [ Map | Transit
     * | Satellite ] views to look at an area on the map.
     * In some cases, button groups may serve as quick filters as well. For example
     * a list of contacts, in which the user can switch to [ All | Favorites
     * | Frequently contacted ] can incorporate a button group to quickly filter out
     * items and display subsets of them.
     * ## Layout
     * The button groups are usually placed in top headers and action bars,
     * sometimes with other elements. Since the group items will always be rendered
     * in a row, you must make sure not to have too many buttons in the group.
     * Because if the container of your button group does not get enough space to
     * fit in all its buttons, they will have to truncate their text and may appear
     * very cramped together. Always think about how your button group will appear
     * on a small screen such as phones.
     * :::note
     * Button can contain text or icons, but not both simultaneously!
     * :::
     * Within the group, icon buttons will all have the same width, while each text button
     * inherits its width from its content.

     * Buttons are used to trigger actions. They are typically used to

     * that changes the state of the application.

     * Buttons are placed in areas where it's clear they will initiate
     * an action when clicked.
     * **Chips:**
     * Chips however are elements which may look like buttons, but they are
     * representing choices, filters, or tags, in a small block
     * or clearly bundled into a group. Chips are rarely used alone in the
     * user interface.
     * They are often used in a so called "chip-set", or placed together in
     * a section of the UI, where the user can expect more than one chip to be present.
     * For example, a chip may represent a filter in a filter bar, or a tag in a tag list,
     * or an item in a shopping list.
     * Clicking a chip can also trigger an action, for example toggling a filter ON or OFF,
     * or opening a page with all posts tagged with the tag represented by the chip,
     * or navigating to a page with more information about the item in the shopping list.

     * However, if you need to handle clicks differently depending on which chip
     * was clicked, or whether the click was on a chip or elsewhere, you need to
     * listen to the native `click` event instead.
     * Native `click` events are passed through, and if the click came from
     * a chip, the chip object is available in the event object under
     * `<event object>.Lime.chip`.
     * Example usage:
     * ```ts
     * private handleClick(event: Event) {
     *     if (event && 'Lime' in event && (event.Lime as any).chip) {
     *         if ((event.Lime as { chip: Chip }).chip.href) {

     * A header is the top most visual element in a component, page, card, or a view.
     * ## Usage
     * A header is the first thing that clarifies a context for users.
     * Due to their positions in the UI hierarchy, headers are the most
     * prominent elements of a user interface; and because of that, they carry both
     * vital information and fundamental controls for the area of the interface
     * they represent.
     * For example, when a header is placed on top of a card, it should quickly
     * explain the card to the user. When placed on top of a modal, it should easily
     * clarify what the modal is about. When displayed on top of a fullscreen view,
     * it should indicate where in the system users are, and what part of the app
     * they are looking at.
     * ## Layout
     * The vital information in a header is usually manifested in form of an icon,
     * and a heading. A subheading also could be added to provide supplementary
     * information. There is also a third place for displaying supplementary information
     * or "supporting text", which will be rendered as a part of the subheading.
     * Along with this information, headers can also include actions, controls, or
     * menus.
     * :::important
     * Such actions or menus must affect the entire section of the interface
     * which the header is representing. For example, a _Delete_ button on a card
     * header must delete that entire card and its respective contents all together,
     * not for example a selected item which is visible in the content of that card.
     * :::
     * :::warning
     * Do not user background color on icons in the headers. It is much better and
     * much easier for the eye if your icon itself has a color.
     * Background colors behind icons make them look like "call to action" buttons
     * and take a lot of attention from users.

     * properly on this event and hide the component (preferably by setting the
     * property `open` to `false`).
     * :::
     * ## Usage
     * Use a popover to show **options** or **information** related to the trigger
     * onscreen. A typical use case for popovers is a tooltip, in which you show
     * help text or contextual information to users.
     * Popovers are most appropriate on larger screens but can be used on smaller
     * screens too, as long as their content is responsive and takes into account
     * the context they are displayed on.
     * When a popover is displayed, interactions with other controls are blocked,
     * until user dismisses the popover.
     * ## Layout
     * Popovers has only one slot in which you can import a custom web-component.
     * :::note
     * You must make sure that web-components that you import into the slot has
     * a `width: 100%;` style so that it can horizontally stretch across the popover.
     * However, `width` of the popover can be controlled by specifying a CSS variable
     * of `--popover-surface-width`. If you don't specify any width, the popover
     * will grow as wide as its content.
     * :::
     * :::important
     * Do not make a popover too big. They should never take over the entire screen.
     * If your content is that big, you should probably be using a Modal instead.

     * identifying the element or describing its function for the user,
     * helping them better understand unfamiliar objects that aren't described
     * directly in the UI.
     * ## Interaction
     * The tooltip appears after a slight delay, when the element is hovered;
     * and disappears as soon as the cursor leaves the element.
     * Therefore, users cannot interact with the tip, but if the trigger element
     * itself is interactive, it will remain interactible even with a tooltip bound
     * to it.
     * :::note
     * In order to display the tooltip, the tooltip element and its trigger element
     * must be within the same document or document fragment (the same shadowRoot).
     * Often, it's easiest to just place them next to each other like in the example
     * below, but if you need to, you can place them differently.
     * ```html
     * <limel-button icon="search" id="tooltip-example" />
     * <limel-tooltip label="Search" elementId="tooltip-example" />
     * ```
     * :::
     * ## Usage
     * - Keep in mind that tooltips can be distracting, and can be perceived as an interruption.
     * Use them only when they add significant value.
     * - A good tip is concise, helpful, and informative.
     * Don't explain the obvious or simply repeat what is already on the screen.
     * When used correctly, supplemental info of a tooltip helps to [declutter the UI](/#/DesignGuidelines/decluttering.md/).
     * - If the tip is essential to the primary tasks that the user is performing,
     * such as warnings or important notes, include the information directly in the
     * interface instead.
     * - When a component offers a helper text (e.g. [Input field](/#/component/limel-input-field/)),
     * use that, not a tooltip.
     * - Make sure to use the tooltip on an element that users naturally and
     * effortlessly recognize can be hovered.

     * Button groups are often used to display different views of the same thing. A
     * common example of this component is when you switch between [ Map | Transit
     * | Satellite ] views to look at an area on the map.
     * In some cases, button groups may serve as quick filters as well. For example
     * a list of contacts, in which the user can switch to [ All | Favorites
     * | Frequently contacted ] can incorporate a button group to quickly filter out
     * items and display subsets of them.
     * ## Layout
     * The button groups are usually placed in top headers and action bars,
     * sometimes with other elements. Since the group items will always be rendered
     * in a row, you must make sure not to have too many buttons in the group.
     * Because if the container of your button group does not get enough space to
     * fit in all its buttons, they will have to truncate their text and may appear
     * very cramped together. Always think about how your button group will appear
     * on a small screen such as phones.
     * :::note
     * Button can contain text or icons, but not both simultaneously!
     * :::
     * Within the group, icon buttons will all have the same width, while each text button
     * inherits its width from its content.

     * The Checkbox component is a classic and essential element in UI design that allows
     * users to make multiple selections from a predefined list of options. The Checkbox component is commonly used in forms and settings interfaces to enable users to
     * select one or more items from a list of choices.
     * ## States of a Checkbox
     * When a user clicks or taps on the box, it toggles between two states:
     * Checked and Unchecked.
     * However, a Checkbox can visualize a third state called the "Indeterminate" state.
     * In this state, the checkbox appears as a filled box with a horizontal line or dash inside it.
     * The Indeterminate state is typically used when dealing with checkbox groups
     * that have hierarchical relationships or when the group contains sub-items.
     * This state is used to indicate that that some, but not all, of the items in a group are selected.
     * :::important
     * Checkboxes are sometimes used interchangeably with switches in user interfaces.
     * But there is an important difference between the two! Please read our guidelines about
     * [Switch vs. Checkbox](/#/DesignGuidelines/switch-vs-checkbox.md/).

     * Chips and buttons are both interactive elements in UI design,

     * :::warning
     * Do not use the chip component carelessly, as an alternative for
     * [`limel-button`](#/component/limel-button/) in the UI design!
     * **Buttons:**
     * Buttons are used to trigger actions. They are typically used to
     * submit forms, open dialogs, initiate a process, or perform any action
     * that changes the state of the application.
     * Buttons' labels usually contain action words, in other words, the labels is
     * a _verb in imperative mood_ such as "Submit" or "Delete".
     * Buttons are placed in areas where it's clear they will initiate
     * an action when clicked.
     * **Chips:**
     * Chips however are elements which may look like buttons, but they are
     * representing choices, filters, or tags, in a small block
     * or clearly bundled into a group. Chips are rarely used alone in the
     * user interface.
     * They are often used in a so called "chip-set", or placed together in
     * a section of the UI, where the user can expect more than one chip to be present.
     * For example, a chip may represent a filter in a filter bar, or a tag in a tag list,
     * or an item in a shopping list.
     * Clicking a chip can also trigger an action, for example toggling a filter ON or OFF,
     * or opening a page with all posts tagged with the tag represented by the chip,
     * or navigating to a page with more information about the item in the shopping list.

     * **Regarding `click` and `interact` events:**
     * The `interact` event is emitted when a chip is interacted with, and is
     * the recommended way to listen for chip interactions.
     * However, if you need to handle clicks differently depending on which chip
     * was clicked, or whether the click was on a chip or elsewhere, you need to
     * listen to the native `click` event instead.
     * Native `click` events are passed through, and if the click came from

     * `<event object>.Lime.chip`.
     * Example usage:

     *     if (event && 'Lime' in event && (event.Lime as any).chip) {

     * For example, when a header is placed on top of a card, it should quickly
     * explain the card to the user. When placed on top of a modal, it should easily
     * clarify what the modal is about. When displayed on top of a fullscreen view,
     * it should indicate where in the system users are, and what part of the app
     * they are looking at.
     * ## Layout
     * The vital information in a header is usually manifested in form of an icon,
     * and a heading. A subheading also could be added to provide supplementary
     * information. There is also a third place for displaying supplementary information
     * or "supporting text", which will be rendered as a part of the subheading.
     * Along with this information, headers can also include actions, controls, or
     * menus.
     * :::important
     * Such actions or menus must affect the entire section of the interface
     * which the header is representing. For example, a _Delete_ button on a card
     * header must delete that entire card and its respective contents all together,
     * not for example a selected item which is visible in the content of that card.
     * :::
     * :::warning
     * Do not user background color on icons in the headers. It is much better and
     * much easier for the eye if your icon itself has a color.
     * Background colors behind icons make them look like "call to action" buttons
     * and take a lot of attention from users.

     * A popover is an impermanent layer that is displayed on top of other content

     * practically anything, a button, piece of text, and icon, etc.
     * Popovers are nonmodal, thus they don't have a semi-transparent backdrop layer
     * that darkens the content below them. Also for the same reason, they can be
     * dismissed by tapping or clicking another part of the screen, but not by a
     * clicking a button or link on the popover itself.
     * :::warning
     * The component is emitting a close event when you click outside its container
     * or press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key. However, it’s up to you as consumer to react
     * properly on this event and hide the component (preferably by setting the
     * property `open` to `false`).
     * :::
     * ## Usage
     * Use a popover to show **options** or **information** related to the trigger
     * onscreen. A typical use case for popovers is a tooltip, in which you show
     * help text or contextual information to users.
     * Popovers are most appropriate on larger screens but can be used on smaller
     * screens too, as long as their content is responsive and takes into account
     * the context they are displayed on.
     * When a popover is displayed, interactions with other controls are blocked,
     * until user dismisses the popover.
     * ## Layout
     * Popovers has only one slot in which you can import a custom web-component.
     * :::note
     * You must make sure that web-components that you import into the slot has
     * a `width: 100%;` style so that it can horizontally stretch across the popover.
     * However, `width` of the popover can be controlled by specifying a CSS variable
     * of `--popover-surface-width`. If you don't specify any width, the popover
     * will grow as wide as its content.
     * :::
     * :::important
     * Do not make a popover too big. They should never take over the entire screen.
     * If your content is that big, you should probably be using a Modal instead.

     * Tabs are great to organize information hierarchically in the interface and divide it into distinct categories. Using tabs, you can create groups of content that are related and at the same level in the hierarchy.
     * :::warning
     * Tab bars should be strictly used for navigation at the top levels.
     * They should never be used to perform actions, or navigate away from the view which contains them.
     * :::
     * An exception for using tab bars in a high level of hierarchy is their usage in modals. This is because modals are perceived as a separate place and not a part of the current context. Therefore you can use tab bars in a modal to group and organize its content.
     * A tab bar can contain an unlimited number of tabs. However, depending on the device width and width of the tabs, the number of tabs that are visible at the same time will vary. When there is limited horizontal space, the component shows a left-arrow and/or right-arrow button, which scrolls and reveals the additional tabs. The tab bar can also be swiped left and right on a touch-device.
     * :::tip Other things to consider
     * Never divide the content of a tab using a nested tab bar.
     * Never place two tab bars within the same screen.
     * Never use background color for icons in tabs.
     * Avoid having long labels for tabs.
     * A tab will never be removed or get disabled, even if there is no content under it.

     * identifying the element or describing its function for the user,
     * helping them better understand unfamiliar objects that aren't described
     * directly in the UI.
     * ## Interaction
     * The tooltip appears after a slight delay, when the element is hovered;
     * and disappears as soon as the cursor leaves the element.
     * Therefore, users cannot interact with the tip, but if the trigger element
     * itself is interactive, it will remain interactible even with a tooltip bound
     * to it.
     * :::note
     * In order to display the tooltip, the tooltip element and its trigger element
     * must be within the same document or document fragment (the same shadowRoot).
     * Often, it's easiest to just place them next to each other like in the example
     * below, but if you need to, you can place them differently.
     * ```html
     * <limel-button icon="search" id="tooltip-example" />
     * <limel-tooltip label="Search" elementId="tooltip-example" />
     * ```
     * :::
     * ## Usage
     * - Keep in mind that tooltips can be distracting, and can be perceived as an interruption.
     * Use them only when they add significant value.
     * - A good tip is concise, helpful, and informative.
     * Don't explain the obvious or simply repeat what is already on the screen.
     * When used correctly, supplemental info of a tooltip helps to [declutter the UI](/#/DesignGuidelines/decluttering.md/).
     * - If the tip is essential to the primary tasks that the user is performing,
     * such as warnings or important notes, include the information directly in the
     * interface instead.
     * - When a component offers a helper text (e.g. [Input field](/#/component/limel-input-field/)),
     * use that, not a tooltip.
     * - Make sure to use the tooltip on an element that users naturally and
     * effortlessly recognize can be hovered.

     * items and display subsets of them.
     * ## Layout
     * The button groups are usually placed in top headers and action bars,
     * sometimes with other elements. Since the group items will always be rendered
     * in a row, you must make sure not to have too many buttons in the group.
     * Because if the container of your button group does not get enough space to
     * fit in all its buttons, they will have to truncate their text and may appear
     * very cramped together. Always think about how your button group will appear
     * on a small screen such as phones.
     * :::note
     * Button can contain text or icons, but not both simultaneously!
     * :::
     * Within the group, icon buttons will all have the same width, while each text button
     * inherits its width from its content.

     * ## States of a Checkbox
     * When a user clicks or taps on the box, it toggles between two states:
     * Checked and Unchecked.
     * However, a Checkbox can visualize a third state called the "Indeterminate" state.
     * In this state, the checkbox appears as a filled box with a horizontal line or dash inside it.
     * The Indeterminate state is typically used when dealing with checkbox groups
     * that have hierarchical relationships or when the group contains sub-items.
     * This state is used to indicate that that some, but not all, of the items in a group are selected.
     * :::important

     * Do not use the chip component carelessly, as an alternative for
     * [`limel-button`](#/component/limel-button/) in the UI design!
     * **Buttons:**
     * Buttons are used to trigger actions. They are typically used to
     * submit forms, open dialogs, initiate a process, or perform any action
     * that changes the state of the application.
     * Buttons' labels usually contain action words, in other words, the labels is
     * a _verb in imperative mood_ such as "Submit" or "Delete".
     * Buttons are placed in areas where it's clear they will initiate
     * an action when clicked.
     * **Chips:**
     * Chips however are elements which may look like buttons, but they are
     * representing choices, filters, or tags, in a small block
     * or clearly bundled into a group. Chips are rarely used alone in the
     * user interface.
     * They are often used in a so called "chip-set", or placed together in
     * a section of the UI, where the user can expect more than one chip to be present.
     * For example, a chip may represent a filter in a filter bar, or a tag in a tag list,
     * or an item in a shopping list.
     * Clicking a chip can also trigger an action, for example toggling a filter ON or OFF,
     * or opening a page with all posts tagged with the tag represented by the chip,
     * or navigating to a page with more information about the item in the shopping list.

     * A header is the top most visual element in a component, page, card, or a view.
     * ## Usage
     * A header is the first thing that clarifies a context for users.
     * Due to their positions in the UI hierarchy, headers are the most
     * prominent elements of a user interface; and because of that, they carry both
     * vital information and fundamental controls for the area of the interface
     * they represent.
     * For example, when a header is placed on top of a card, it should quickly
     * explain the card to the user. When placed on top of a modal, it should easily
     * clarify what the modal is about. When displayed on top of a fullscreen view,
     * it should indicate where in the system users are, and what part of the app
     * they are looking at.
     * ## Layout
     * The vital information in a header is usually manifested in form of an icon,
     * and a heading. A subheading also could be added to provide supplementary
     * information. There is also a third place for displaying supplementary information
     * or "supporting text", which will be rendered as a part of the subheading.
     * Along with this information, headers can also include actions, controls, or
     * menus.
     * :::important
     * Such actions or menus must affect the entire section of the interface
     * which the header is representing. For example, a _Delete_ button on a card
     * header must delete that entire card and its respective contents all together,
     * not for example a selected item which is visible in the content of that card.
     * :::
     * :::warning
     * Do not user background color on icons in the headers. It is much better and
     * much easier for the eye if your icon itself has a color.
     * Background colors behind icons make them look like "call to action" buttons
     * and take a lot of attention from users.

     * A popover is an impermanent layer that is displayed on top of other content
     * when user taps an element that triggers the popover. This element can be
     * practically anything, a button, piece of text, and icon, etc.
     * Popovers are nonmodal, thus they don't have a semi-transparent backdrop layer
     * that darkens the content below them. Also for the same reason, they can be
     * dismissed by tapping or clicking another part of the screen, but not by a
     * clicking a button or link on the popover itself.
     * :::warning
     * The component is emitting a close event when you click outside its container
     * or press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key. However, it’s up to you as consumer to react
     * properly on this event and hide the component (preferably by setting the
     * property `open` to `false`).
     * :::
     * ## Usage
     * Use a popover to show **options** or **information** related to the trigger
     * onscreen. A typical use case for popovers is a tooltip, in which you show
     * help text or contextual information to users.
     * Popovers are most appropriate on larger screens but can be used on smaller
     * screens too, as long as their content is responsive and takes into account
     * the context they are displayed on.
     * When a popover is displayed, interactions with other controls are blocked,
     * until user dismisses the popover.
     * ## Layout
     * Popovers has only one slot in which you can import a custom web-component.
     * :::note
     * You must make sure that web-components that you import into the slot has
     * a `width: 100%;` style so that it can horizontally stretch across the popover.
     * However, `width` of the popover can be controlled by specifying a CSS variable
     * of `--popover-surface-width`. If you don't specify any width, the popover
     * will grow as wide as its content.
     * :::
     * :::important
     * Do not make a popover too big. They should never take over the entire screen.
     * If your content is that big, you should probably be using a Modal instead.

     * identifying the element or describing its function for the user,
     * helping them better understand unfamiliar objects that aren't described
     * directly in the UI.
     * ## Interaction
     * The tooltip appears after a slight delay, when the element is hovered;
     * and disappears as soon as the cursor leaves the element.
     * Therefore, users cannot interact with the tip, but if the trigger element
     * itself is interactive, it will remain interactible even with a tooltip bound
     * to it.
     * :::note
     * In order to display the tooltip, the tooltip element and its trigger element
     * must be within the same document or document fragment (the same shadowRoot).
     * Often, it's easiest to just place them next to each other like in the example
     * below, but if you need to, you can place them differently.
     * ```html
     * <limel-button icon="search" id="tooltip-example" />
     * <limel-tooltip label="Search" elementId="tooltip-example" />
     * ```
     * :::
     * ## Usage
     * - Keep in mind that tooltips can be distracting, and can be perceived as an interruption.
     * Use them only when they add significant value.
     * - A good tip is concise, helpful, and informative.
     * Don't explain the obvious or simply repeat what is already on the screen.
     * When used correctly, supplemental info of a tooltip helps to [declutter the UI](/#/DesignGuidelines/decluttering.md/).
     * - If the tip is essential to the primary tasks that the user is performing,
     * such as warnings or important notes, include the information directly in the
     * interface instead.
     * - When a component offers a helper text (e.g. [Input field](/#/component/limel-input-field/)),
     * use that, not a tooltip.
     * - Make sure to use the tooltip on an element that users naturally and
     * effortlessly recognize can be hovered.

             * Button groups are often used to display different views of the same thing. A
             * common example of this component is when you switch between [ Map | Transit
             * | Satellite ] views to look at an area on the map.
             * In some cases, button groups may serve as quick filters as well. For example
             * a list of contacts, in which the user can switch to [ All | Favorites
             * | Frequently contacted ] can incorporate a button group to quickly filter out
             * items and display subsets of them.
             * ## Layout
             * The button groups are usually placed in top headers and action bars,
             * sometimes with other elements. Since the group items will always be rendered
             * in a row, you must make sure not to have too many buttons in the group.
             * Because if the container of your button group does not get enough space to
             * fit in all its buttons, they will have to truncate their text and may appear

             * The Indeterminate state is typically used when dealing with checkbox groups

             * **Buttons:**
             * Buttons are used to trigger actions. They are typically used to
             * submit forms, open dialogs, initiate a process, or perform any action
             * that changes the state of the application.
             * Buttons' labels usually contain action words, in other words, the labels is

             * Buttons are placed in areas where it's clear they will initiate

             * **Chips:**
             * Chips however are elements which may look like buttons, but they are
             * representing choices, filters, or tags, in a small block
             * or clearly bundled into a group. Chips are rarely used alone in the
             * user interface.
             * They are often used in a so called "chip-set", or placed together in
             * a section of the UI, where the user can expect more than one chip to be present.
             * For example, a chip may represent a filter in a filter bar, or a tag in a tag list,
             * or an item in a shopping list.
             * Clicking a chip can also trigger an action, for example toggling a filter ON or OFF,
             * or opening a page with all posts tagged with the tag represented by the chip,

             * The `interact` event is emitted when a chip is interacted with, and is
             * the recommended way to listen for chip interactions.
             * However, if you need to handle clicks differently depending on which chip

             * A header is the top most visual element in a component, page, card, or a view.
             * ## Usage
             * A header is the first thing that clarifies a context for users.
             * Due to their positions in the UI hierarchy, headers are the most
             * prominent elements of a user interface; and because of that, they carry both
             * vital information and fundamental controls for the area of the interface
             * they represent.
             * For example, when a header is placed on top of a card, it should quickly
             * explain the card to the user. When placed on top of a modal, it should easily
             * clarify what the modal is about. When displayed on top of a fullscreen view,
             * it should indicate where in the system users are, and what part of the app
             * they are looking at.
             * ## Layout
             * The vital information in a header is usually manifested in form of an icon,
             * and a heading. A subheading also could be added to provide supplementary
             * information. There is also a third place for displaying supplementary information
             * or "supporting text", which will be rendered as a part of the subheading.
             * Along with this information, headers can also include actions, controls, or
             * menus.
             * :::important
             * Such actions or menus must affect the entire section of the interface
             * which the header is representing. For example, a _Delete_ button on a card
             * header must delete that entire card and its respective contents all together,
             * not for example a selected item which is visible in the content of that card.
             * :::
             * :::warning
             * Do not user background color on icons in the headers. It is much better and
             * much easier for the eye if your icon itself has a color.
             * Background colors behind icons make them look like "call to action" buttons
             * and take a lot of attention from users.

             * A popover is an impermanent layer that is displayed on top of other content
             * when user taps an element that triggers the popover. This element can be
             * practically anything, a button, piece of text, and icon, etc.
             * Popovers are nonmodal, thus they don't have a semi-transparent backdrop layer
             * that darkens the content below them. Also for the same reason, they can be
             * dismissed by tapping or clicking another part of the screen, but not by a
             * clicking a button or link on the popover itself.
             * :::warning
             * The component is emitting a close event when you click outside its container
             * or press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key. However, it’s up to you as consumer to react
             * properly on this event and hide the component (preferably by setting the
             * property `open` to `false`).
             * :::
             * ## Usage
             * Use a popover to show **options** or **information** related to the trigger
             * onscreen. A typical use case for popovers is a tooltip, in which you show
             * help text or contextual information to users.
             * Popovers are most appropriate on larger screens but can be used on smaller
             * screens too, as long as their content is responsive and takes into account
             * the context they are displayed on.
             * When a popover is displayed, interactions with other controls are blocked,
             * until user dismisses the popover.
             * ## Layout
             * Popovers has only one slot in which you can import a custom web-component.
             * :::note
             * You must make sure that web-components that you import into the slot has
             * a `width: 100%;` style so that it can horizontally stretch across the popover.
             * However, `width` of the popover can be controlled by specifying a CSS variable
             * of `--popover-surface-width`. If you don't specify any width, the popover
             * will grow as wide as its content.
             * :::
             * :::important
             * Do not make a popover too big. They should never take over the entire screen.
             * If your content is that big, you should probably be using a Modal instead.

             * :::

             * - Keep in mind that tooltips can be distracting, and can be perceived as an interruption.
             * Use them only when they add significant value.
             * - A good tip is concise, helpful, and informative.
             * Don't explain the obvious or simply repeat what is already on the screen.
             * When used correctly, supplemental info of a tooltip helps to [declutter the UI](/#/DesignGuidelines/decluttering.md/).
             * - If the tip is essential to the primary tasks that the user is performing,
             * such as warnings or important notes, include the information directly in the
             * interface instead.
             * - When a component offers a helper text (e.g. [Input field](/#/component/limel-input-field/)),
             * use that, not a tooltip.
             * - Make sure to use the tooltip on an element that users naturally and
             * effortlessly recognize can be hovered.
