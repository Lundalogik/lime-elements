# Color system


## Extended color palette
A rich set of colors, primarily intended for visual communications, iconography, illustrations, and charts.

These colors are taken from Material Design's 2014 color palettes. But we have divided them into two different subsets of colors which automatically adjust to Dark and Light themes. All colors with odd color weights (100, 300, 500, 700) are automatically picked and displayed in the Light Mode; and all weights with odd values (200, 400, 600, 800) are alternatively displayed in the Dark Mode. The 900 color weight is persistently displayed in both modes.


## Primary color palette
To limit and ease choice of colors. Used for primary purposes and meaningful communications with colors. For example to indicate notions such as danger, caution, safe, error, etc...



## Contrast palette
For generic interface elements, and a consistent, self sustaining UI design, which automatically adjusts itself to Dark and Light moods.



## Brand colors
For branding and marketing purposes. Some of these swatches are already in our extended color palette (in the "light" mode subset), as stated below their names.
