# How to use lime-elements
Generally speaking, the examples of the lime-elements components are meant to show off their key features 
and make it easy to use them in other projects. Unfortunately you have to pay attention to some details.

## Import statements 
Some components use interfaces which are referred to in the examples with a relative path like this: 
```ts
import { Option } from '../../interface';
```
When using those interfaces in your own project, the import path changes to: 
```ts
import { Option } from 'lime-elements';
```
