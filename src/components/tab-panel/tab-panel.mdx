# Tab panel 

The `tab-panel` component uses the `tab-bar` component together with custom slotted components and will display the content for the currently active tab. Each slotted component must have an id equal to the id of the corresponding tab it belongs to.

The `tab-panel` component will automatically set each tab configuration on the corresponding slotted component as a property named `tab` so that the component can take action upon that. Sometimes it might be desirable to not load data or render anything until the tab is active. 

The slotted components can also emit the `changeTab` event to update anything inside the actual tab, e.g. to change the icon, color or badge.

<limel-props name="limel-tab-panel" />

## Example

This example illustrates how to add custom components inside the `tab-panel`. Each component will simulate loading the data it needs once the tab has been activated and then display the actual content. If the button is pressed, the component will emit the `changeTab` event to change the badge inside the corresponding tab.

<limel-example name="limel-example-tab-panel" />

### Custom component

This is the component that is used in the panel for each tab in the example above.

<limel-example name="limel-example-tab-panel-content" path="tab-panel" code-only={true} />
