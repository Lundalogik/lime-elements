/**
 * Allowing to deselect a selected radio button
 *
 * In native radio button groups, users cannot deselect an already selected radio button.
 * This is the standard behavior across most implementations; which we also showcased in the
 * "Basic example", before this one. However, this interaction design comes with a
 * significant user experience drawback. Once a user selects one choice, they cannot regret their choice.
 * This could be problematic in some designs such as forms or survey.
 * This is because a user cannot first answer a single choice question,
 * and then decide to skip that question and leave it unanswered.
 *
 * As a developer, for such scenarios you always have to remember to provide a N/A choice or similar,
 * to enable the user or respondents to skip that question.
 * However, having a radio button group in a survey that allows respondents to leave it
 * unanswered means that the question cannot be marked as "Required" or "Compulsory".
 * A required question works best, when user has to select an option, and cannot unselect it.
 *
 * See how `handleChange` is implemented in this example, and compare it to the Basic example
 * which does not allow deselecting the currently selected option.
