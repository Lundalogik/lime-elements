/**
 * Input Field with Leading Icon
 *
 * A leading icon can be used to visually "decorate" the input field. The
 * purpose for adding a leading icon should be to help the user understand what
 * the field is for.
 *
 * In this example, we use a map icon in addition to the "Address" label, to
 * indicate that this field is meant for a physical address.
 *
 * The example has a minimum length just to show what an invalid field looks
 * like.
