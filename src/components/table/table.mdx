## Low density table
By adding `has-low-dansity` class to the table, you can easily convert the table into an airy list of items.

This type of UI is suitable for generating minimalist lists of items with only a few properties on each. Especially when the property values are not self-explanatory (such as an email address) and require a bit of extra help to know what they are.

Using this UI, you can take advantage of the sticky header of the table which explains what each cell is about, and also enjoy sorting possibilities it offers.

### Usage notes
- In this low-density UI, all cells will get a fixed height, which may affect the layout of custom components that you place inside them.
- This UI is not preferred for data intensive views, in which the user's main task is processing the presented data and making sense of it. For such views, use the table component with its normal density.

## Clickable rows
By taking advantage of the `has-interactive-rows` class, hovering on a row will display an elevated visual effect, giving it more affordance and a solid feeling of interactivity.

### Usage notes
- Only use this class when clicking on an entire row triggers a reaction in the system, for example a card or a modal is opened to show further details.
