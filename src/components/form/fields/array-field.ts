/**
 * This override field exists to supplement the need to reset dependent fields
 * in SchemaField. The `resetDependentFields` function requires that the schema that
 * is passed to it be a raw schema with dependencies and all. However, when rendering list items
 * react jsonschema form calls `retrieveSchema` on the raw schema resulting in a schema for the current
 * data. This schema from `retrieveSchema` cannot be used to detect changes in a schema due to data changes
 * as the schema will not change when passed again into `retrieveSchema` with old and then new data.
 * So since the SchemaFields directly rendered by a list have a modified schema, they cannot properly reset
 * dependent fields by calling `resetDependentFields` due to the above limitations. To fix this, we do the
 * same resetting of dependent fields here in this component by detecting changed list items and calling
 * `resetDependentFields` on the changed list items. This is possible because the ArrayField is also given
 * the raw schema so it can properly call `resetDependentFields`
 *
 * This form has to handle several events that can affect the list:
 *
 * 1. An on change where no list item changes
 * Solution: Ignore all changes and just pass the event through
 *
 * 2. An on change where one list item is changed
 * Solution: Call `resetDependentFields` with the old list item and the new list item as old and new data
 *
 * 3. An on change event where the size of the list of items has changed due to adding or removing a list item
 * Solution: Ignore all changes and just pass the event through
 *
 * 4. An on change event where list items are swapped or scrambled due to list items being swapped or sorted
 * Solution: Ignore all changes and just pass the event through
