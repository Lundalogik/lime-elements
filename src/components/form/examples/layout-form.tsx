/**
 * Layout
 * By default, each item in a limel-form will be rendered in a single row, and
 * each row occupies the entire available width of the form's container.
 *
 * This default layout may work fine on small screens or narrow containers,
 * but on larger screens it usually won't produce a nice layout. Thus we
 * recommend that you choose an appropriate responsive layout for your form.
 *
 * ###### Enabling responsive layouts
 *
 * By specifying `'grid'` as the layout `type` in your schema, as well as your desired
 * number of `columns`, you can leave the job of responsively handling the form
 * layout to Lime Elements.
 * ```ts
 * export const schema = {
 * type: 'object',
 * lime: {
 * layout: {
 * type: 'grid',
 * columns: 3,
 * },
 * },
 * â€¦
 * };
 * ```
 * :::note
 * Value for `columns` can only be `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, or `1`. If you do not
 * specify a value, `limel-form` will choose `5` by default.
 * :::
 *
 * So if you have chosen `4` for instance, the form will do its best to fit
 * four columns in a row. But for smaller containers in which placement of four
 * items per row is not possible, the form will automatically change the layout
 * and fit 3 items per row. As the container's width decreases, the number of
 * columns will also decrease.
 *
 * :::tip
 * You can divide a form into sections,
 * and specify a different layout for each section.
 * :::
 *
 * In this example, each collapsible section has its own `colSpan`.
 * However, since the layout is responsive, make sure to change the browser
 * window size to see how their responsive layout changes.
