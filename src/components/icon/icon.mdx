# Icon

The recommended icon library for use with Lime Elements is the Windows 10 set from Icons8 (https://icons8.com/icons/windows). This set is included in the relevant Lime products. If you are using Lime Elements in a non-Lime product, you will have to supply your own icons.

The size and color of the icon is set in CSS, however there are a few standard sizes defined that can be used with the `size` property.

## Setup

* To use **@limetech/lime-icons8**, the `/assets` folder from **@limetech/lime-icons8** must be made available on the webserver.
* To use a different icon set, the icons must be placed in a folder structure that looks like this: `assets/icons/<name-of-icon>.svg`

If `assets` is placed in the root, no other setup is needed. The icons will be fetched with a relative URL from `assets/icons/<name-of-icon>.svg`.

If `assets` is placed in a sub-folder somewhere, the easiest way to make the icons available is to use the HTML `base` element:

```
<base href="/my/parent/path/">
```

If this is not enough, or if the `base` element is already in use for something else, a global icon path can be configured with the `limel-config` element:

```jsx
<limel-config config={{iconPath: '/my/parent/path/'}} />
```

<limel-props name="limel-icon" />

## Example
<limel-example name="limel-example-icon" /> 

## Example with background color
<limel-example name="limel-example-icon-background" path="icon" />
