/**
 * Sub-menus
 * To have an enhanced navigation and provide a better organization of items,
 * you can incorporate sub-menus within the menu structure;
 * and create a so called "Cascading menu".
 * These sub-menus provide the user with an efficient way to access a
 * wide range of choices without overwhelming them with clutter or complexity.
 *
 * The main menu, often called the parent menu,
 * typically consists of top-level options that represent primary categories or options.
 * Sub-menus, on the other hand, are secondary or menus that are nested
 * beneath these primary options.
 *
 * Some of the benefits of creating tree-structure for the menus are:
 * - **Organized Information:** Sub-menus enable a clear and organized presentation of content,
 * making it easier for the user to find what they're looking for within a specific category.
 * - **Space Efficiency:** They save screen space by concealing secondary options until needed,
 * reducing visual clutter and making the interface cleaner and more user-friendly.
 * - **Scalability:** Sub-menus can accommodate a large number of choices or features
 * within a single parent menu, making them suitable for complex applications or websites.
 * - **Logical Hierarchy:** By structuring information hierarchically,
 * sub-menus help the user understand the relationships between various
 * options and navigate through the interface more intuitively.
 *
 * Our cascading menus are designed to be mobile-friendly.
 * This means that sub-menus are opened within the same menu surface,
 * instead of the classic way of sticking out on the side, as a secondary menu.
 * Thanks to a breadcrumbs component on the top, the user can easily navigate back
 * and forth within the menu structure.
 *
 * :::tip
 * It is also very easy to navigate the nested menu structure using the keyboard.
 *
 * - Using the <kbd>↓</kbd> & <kbd>↑</kbd> keys, the user can naturally
 * navigate within the presented menu,
 * - pressing the <kbd>→</kbd> key on a menu item that has sub-menu opens a nested menu,
 * - and pressing the <kbd>←</kbd> key takes the user back to the previous/parent menu.
