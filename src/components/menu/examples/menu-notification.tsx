/**
 * With notification
 *
 * It is possible to display a notification badge on each individual
 * list item inside the menu's dropdown.
 *
 * These notification badges are supposed to inform the user that
 * there is something in the menu item that requires their attention.
 *
 * This is typically done by displaying a number, which summarizes
 * the quantity of the items that require user's attention.
 * However, if a number is not meaningful, it is possible to send an
 * empty string (`badge: ''`), which will display a circle on the
 * list item.
 *
 * Since list items in the menu are hidden away, users would not
 * realize that there is something inside the menu which requires their
 * attention. Which is why the trigger automatically displays a
 * notification badge on its top-right corner,
 * when the menu contains badges.
 *
 * By default, the badge is red and its text is white.
 * This is to attract users' attention. However, this is possible to override using
 * [provided style variables](/#/component/limel-menu/styles/).
 *
 * :::warning
 * - Do not negatively exploit this possibility and spam users' attention.
 * Crowding the UI with too much noise _will_ negatively affect the user experience.
 * - Notification badges *must* be cleared as soon as the list item is clicked by the user!
