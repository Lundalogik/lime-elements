# Button

<limel-props name="limel-button" />

## Example

<limel-example name="limel-example-button" />

### With click handler

The click handler in this example sets the attributes `loading` and `disabled` to `true`. After 1 second, the `loading`
attribute is set to `false` again. After another 4 seconds, the button is once again enabled.
                    
When the `loading` attribute changes from `true` to `false`, the button automatically displays a checkmark icon for 2 
seconds. Note that our click handler isn't actually involved in this.

<limel-example name="limel-example-button-click" path="button"/>
