/**
 * Proper usage of icons
 *
 * Sometimes, your design requires displaying a single icon inside a button,
 * without any visible label.
 *
 * In such scenarios, the `title` property of the icon must be used to
 * improve accessibility for unsighted users.
 *
 * When a proper `label` is chosen for a button, it is descriptive enough for
 * the users to understand the meaning of the action.
 * In such cases, the icon is primarily used to improve
 * the visual appearance of the item, and make it more quickly and easily recognizable
 * for the users.
 *
 * However, some designs favor a cleaner and more minimal user interface,
 * by removing unnecessary words, relying on an already present icon which
 * can be interpreted as a word by the user.
 *
 * Here you see examples of such icons followed by a short text:
 * - **‚ûï icon followed by "Todo"**: For a sighted user,
 * this combination of icon and text would be interpreted as "Add New Todo"
 * - **üîÑ icon followed by "List"**: Would be visually read as "Refresh List"
 * - **üóëÔ∏è icon followed by "Selected"**: Would be visually read as "Delete Selected"
 *
 * For sighted users, the text is enough to understand the meaning of the action,
 * but a screen reader cannot interpret the icon as a word, unless you provide a
 * proper `title` property for the icon. In fact, the icons that have no `title`
 * are completely hidden from the screen readers.
 *
 * This example showcases how user experience can be improved not only for both
 * users of assistive technologies, but also for those who see a descriptive tooltip,
 * while hovering the action, which is constructed from the combination of
 * the `title` and `text`.
