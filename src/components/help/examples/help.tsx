#### Why providing contextual help is important

1. **It promotes user engagement.**
    When users encounter assistance at strategic points within the interface,
    frustration diminishes, and satisfaction grows.
    This positive experience contributes to increased user retention,
    as individuals are more likely to continue using
    an app that aligns with their needs and supports them on their journey.
2. **It help serves as a means of communication between the app and its users.**
    It enables developers to provide users with information about
    the appâ€™s functionality, or about the actions that the user is expected to do,
    to complete a task or move to the next step in a process.
