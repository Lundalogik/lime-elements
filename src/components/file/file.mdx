# File

This component lets end-users select **only one** file from their device storage. Regardless of the user's device or operating system, this component opens up a file picker dialog that allows the user to choose a file.

<limel-props name="limel-file" />

## Using correct labels

This file picker can be used in different contexts. The component's distinct visual design including the upload icon hits end-users that this is not a normal input field like other fileds in the form for example.

However, you need to make sure whether you are using a descriptive `label` that clarifies the functionality of the file picker, and or provides users with clear instructions.

Depending on the context, you may need to avoid labels such as:
- File
- Document

and instead consider using labels like:
- Attach a file
- Upload a file
- Choose a document
- Choose a file
- and similar...

## Example

<limel-example name="limel-example-file" />
