/**
 * Basic example
 *
 * This component does its best to offer a responsive layout
 * that reacts both to the length of text, and size of the container.
 *
 * :::note
 * To use this component properly, you need to define both
 * a declared `height` and a declared `width` for it. Alternatively,
 * make sure that its container enforces a width and height,
 * for instance, use it as a flex or grid child.
 * :::
 *
 * In this example, you can resize the component to see how it
 * tries to adjust its content to the size of its container.
 *
 * :::tip
 * Try to avoid long textual content to get
 * the best possible visualization. They can cause
 * undesired overlapping of the content, depending on the size of the
 * component.
 * :::
