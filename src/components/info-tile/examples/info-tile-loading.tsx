/**
 * Loading state
 *
 * Sometimes the value needs to be calculated, updated, or fetched
 * through a process that requires some time. In such cases, it is
 * a great idea to let the users know that the data is being updated.
 *
 * To do so, set the `loading` property to `true`. The component will then
 * show an indeterminate progressbar indicating the data is being updated,
 * while the older value is still being displayed.
 *
 * :::note
 * Note that this does _not_ disable the link, and most probably you
 * do not need it to be disabled either.
 * If the link should be disabled while loading, the
 * `disabled` property should be set to `true` as well.
