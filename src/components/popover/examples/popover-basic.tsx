/**
 * Basic example
 * This example shows a simple trigger element that opens a popover when clicked.
 *
 * :::note
 * Due accessibility concerns, the trigger element should be something that can be
 * interacted with, using both mouse click and the <kbd>  spacebar  </kbd>
 * or the <kbd>↩ return</kbd> key on the keyboard.
 *
 * This is why we are using a `limel-button` element as the trigger in this example,
 * which is both accessible with mouse and keyboard.
 * :::
 *
 * :::warning
 * The component is emitting a close event when you click outside its container
 * or press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key. However, it’s up to you as consumer to react
 * properly on this event and hide the component (preferably by setting the
 * property `open` to `false`).
