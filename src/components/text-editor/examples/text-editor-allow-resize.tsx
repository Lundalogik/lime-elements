/**
 * Allow resize
 * The text editor automatically adjusts its own height to fit the content inside.
 * So as the user types, the editor will grow taller, potentially resizing its own
 * container element.
 *
 * By default, the user can also manually change the height of the text editor
 * by dragging its bottom right corner.
 *
 * As soon as the user has changed the height, this will override the automatic
 * resizing, and the editor will no longer adjust its height to fit the content inside.
 *
 * By setting `allowResize` to `false`, you can disable the end user
 * to resize the text editor vertically.
 *
 * :::tip
 * 1. The text editor makes sure that it never becomes taller than the viewport's height.
 * This way, its toolbar and resize control will remain reasonably visible, when
 * the component is auto resizing itself based on the content it holds.
 * This behavior is controlled by the `--text-editor-max-height` CSS variable,
 * which defaults to `calc(100vh - (env(safe-area-inset-top) + env(safe-area-inset-bottom)) - 4rem)`,
 * taking also into account the safe zones which are defined by the environment variables.
 *
 * 1. Using `max-height` and `min-height` CSS properties on the component itself,
 * (or using `--text-editor-max-height`), you can limit the resizing to a specific range.
