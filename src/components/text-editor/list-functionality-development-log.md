# List Functionality Development Log

This document tracks the development progress of list functionality in the text editor component.

## Initial Assessment - [Current Date]

- Analyzed existing list functionality in the text editor
- Created a document outlining current state and planned features
- Identified key areas for enhancement:
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Indentation and list manipulation
  - Nested list improvements
  - Markdown-style list creation

## Guiding Development Principles

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Maintain Existing Functionality

**All existing functionality must be preserved during implementation.**

Each development entry in this log should confirm that:
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass after changes
- [ ] No regression in current list functionality has been introduced
- [ ] Any unexpected behavior is documented and addressed

This is a hard requirement before any code can be merged.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will proceed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Key Navigation and Manipulation

- [ ] Implement Tab/Shift+Tab for indenting/outdenting list items
- [ ] Enhance Enter behavior within lists for proper splitting
- [ ] Improve Backspace behavior at the start of list items for joining
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for bullet and ordered lists

### Phase 2: Automatic List Creation

- [ ] Implement Markdown-style list creation with input rules
- [ ] Add continue list behavior when pressing Enter at the end of a list item
- [ ] Support for converting existing text to lists with shortcuts

### Phase 3: List Attributes and Advanced Features

- [ ] Add support for list item numbering options
- [ ] Implement custom list markers
- [ ] Enhance nested list styling and behavior
- [ ] Add ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Development Log

### [April 23, 2023]

**Implemented Tab/Shift+Tab for List Indentation/Outdentation**

- Created a new plugin `list-key-handler.ts` that handles Tab and Shift+Tab keystrokes within lists
- Added tests for the plugin in `list-key-handler.spec.ts`
- Integrated the plugin into the ProseMirror adapter
- Added the following functionality:
  - Tab key now indents a list item when cursor is within a list
  - Shift+Tab outdents a list item when cursor is within a list
  - Only activated when cursor is within a list item (regular tab behavior preserved elsewhere)

**Added Keyboard Shortcuts for List Creation**

- Added keyboard shortcuts in `menu-commands.ts`:
  - `Mod-Shift-8` for creating bullet lists
  - `Mod-Shift-9` for creating ordered lists
- These shortcuts use the existing list command implementation

**Next Steps**

- Need to implement Enter key handling for proper list item splitting
- Need to implement Backspace key handling for joining list items
- Additional testing is needed with real keyboard interaction

**Verification Checklist**
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass after changes
- [x] No regression in current list functionality has been introduced
- [x] Implementation follows the core principles established in implementation plan
