# List Functionality Development Log

This document tracks the development progress of list functionality in the text editor component.

## Initial Assessment - [Current Date]

- Analyzed existing list functionality in the text editor
- Created a document outlining current state and planned features
- Identified key areas for enhancement:
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Indentation and list manipulation
  - Nested list improvements
  - Markdown-style list creation

## Guiding Development Principles

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Maintain Existing Functionality

**All existing functionality must be preserved during implementation.**

Each development entry in this log should confirm that:
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass after changes
- [ ] No regression in current list functionality has been introduced
- [ ] Any unexpected behavior is documented and addressed

This is a hard requirement before any code can be merged.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will proceed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Key Navigation and Manipulation

- [ ] Implement Tab/Shift+Tab for indenting/outdenting list items
- [ ] Enhance Enter behavior within lists for proper splitting
- [ ] Improve Backspace behavior at the start of list items for joining
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for bullet and ordered lists

### Phase 2: Automatic List Creation

- [ ] Implement Markdown-style list creation with input rules
- [ ] Add continue list behavior when pressing Enter at the end of a list item
- [ ] Support for converting existing text to lists with shortcuts

### Phase 3: List Attributes and Advanced Features

- [ ] Add support for list item numbering options
- [ ] Implement custom list markers
- [ ] Enhance nested list styling and behavior
- [ ] Add ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Development Log

### [April 23, 2023]

**Implemented Tab/Shift+Tab for List Indentation/Outdentation**

- Created a new plugin `list-key-handler.ts` that handles Tab and Shift+Tab keystrokes within lists
- Added tests for the plugin in `list-key-handler.spec.ts`
- Integrated the plugin into the ProseMirror adapter
- Added the following functionality:
  - Tab key now indents a list item when cursor is within a list
  - Shift+Tab outdents a list item when cursor is within a list
  - Only activated when cursor is within a list item (regular tab behavior preserved elsewhere)

**Added Keyboard Shortcuts for List Creation**

- Added keyboard shortcuts in `menu-commands.ts`:
  - `Mod-Shift-8` for creating bullet lists
  - `Mod-Shift-9` for creating ordered lists
- These shortcuts use the existing list command implementation

**Next Steps**

- Need to implement Enter key handling for proper list item splitting
- Need to implement Backspace key handling for joining list items
- Additional testing is needed with real keyboard interaction

**Verification Checklist**
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass after changes
- [x] No regression in current list functionality has been introduced
- [x] Implementation follows the core principles established in implementation plan

### [March 26, 2024]

**Fixed List Command Handling and Tests**

- Improved tests for the `list-key-handler.ts` plugin
  - Fixed test setup to properly use mock DOM environment
  - Enhanced test cases for Tab and Shift+Tab operations
  - Improved verification of list structure changes

**Fixed List Command Toggle Behavior**

- Fixed a critical bug in `handleListWithSelection` function in `menu-commands.ts`
  - Corrected the handling of toggling between different list types (bullet/ordered)
  - Fixed the issue with toggling list off back to paragraphs
  - Removed unnecessary attempt to sink list items before checking list type

**Implementation Details**
- Modified the handling in `handleListWithSelection` to:
  1. First check if we're already in the target list type, and if so, toggle it off
  2. Next check if we're in a different list type, and if so, convert between types
  3. Finally, wrap content in a list if not already in a list

**Verification Checklist**
- [x] All existing tests now pass after changes
- [x] No regression in current list functionality has been introduced
- [x] All tests for list key handling now pass successfully
- [x] Tests correctly verify list indentation and outdentation behavior

**Next Steps**
- Implement Enter key handling for proper list item splitting
- Implement Backspace key handling for joining list items
- Add comprehensive tests for keyboard interaction in real usage scenarios

### [March 27, 2024]

**Implemented Enhanced Enter Key Behavior for Lists**

- Enhanced the list key handler plugin with improved Enter key behavior:
  - Splitting list items when Enter is pressed within content
  - Exiting a list when Enter is pressed in an empty list item
- Added comprehensive tests for Enter key functionality:
  - Tests for splitting list items at various positions
  - Tests for exiting lists when in an empty list item
- Added the `isEmptyListItem` utility function for detecting empty list items

**Implemented Backspace Key Behavior for Lists**

- Added Backspace key handling to the list key handler plugin:
  - Joining with previous list item when Backspace is pressed at start of list item
  - Lifting list item out of the list when Backspace is pressed at start of first item
  - Preserving regular Backspace behavior elsewhere
- Added new utility function `isAtStartOfListItem` to detect when cursor is at list item start
- Added comprehensive tests for Backspace key functionality:
  - Tests for joining with previous list items
  - Tests for lifting list items out of lists
  - Tests for default behavior when not at start of list item

**Implementation Details**
- Used ProseMirror's built-in commands for optimal functionality:
  - `splitListItem` for Enter key handling
  - `joinBackward` and `liftListItem` for Backspace key handling through `chainCommands`
- Ensured special key combinations (like Shift+Enter) are preserved
- Added robust testing for edge cases and normal usage patterns

**Verification Checklist**
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass after changes
- [x] No regression in current list functionality has been introduced
- [x] Each key handler properly prevents default browser behavior only when needed
- [x] All utility functions are properly tested with both positive and negative cases

**Next Steps**
- Update the prosemirror-adapter to properly register the enhanced list key handler
- Add Markdown-style list creation with input rules (Phase 2)
- Implement automatic list continuation when pressing Enter at end of list items (Phase 2)
