 * When the helper line is empty

 * When the component has no content, for example when there is no

 * as style, to avoid creating empty holes in the UI of the consumer component.
 *
 * This is important for example in a `flex` or `grid` component that has a `gap`
 * between its children. If so, we don't want the empty
 * `limel-helper-line` to get rendered and cause unnecessary gaps in the UI.
