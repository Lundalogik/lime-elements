/**
 * A header is the top most visual element in a component, page, card, or a view.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * A header is the first thing that clarifies a context for users.
 * Due to their positions in the UI hierarchy, headers are the most
 * prominent elements of a user interface; and because of that, they carry both
 * vital information and fundamental controls for the area of the interface
 * they represent.
 *
 * For example, when a header is placed on top of a card, it should quickly
 * explain the card to the user. When placed on top of a modal, it should easily
 * clarify what the modal is about. When displayed on top of a fullscreen view,
 * it should indicate where in the system users are, and what part of the app
 * they are looking at.
 *
 *
 * ## Layout
 * The vital information in a header is usually manifested in form of an icon,
 * and a heading. A subheading also could be added to provide supplementary
 * information. There is also a third place for displaying supplementary information
 * or "supporting text", which will be rendered as a part of the subheading.
 * Along with this information, headers can also include actions, controls, or
 * menus.
 *
 * :::important
 * Such actions or menus must affect the entire section of the interface
 * which the header is representing. For example, a _Delete_ button on a card
 * header must delete that entire card and its respective contents all together,
 * not for example a selected item which is visible in the content of that card.
 * :::
 *
 *
 * :::warning
 * Do not user background color on icons in the headers. It is much better and
 * much easier for the eye if your icon itself has a color.
 * Background colors behind icons make them look like "call to action" buttons
 * and take a lot of attention from users.
