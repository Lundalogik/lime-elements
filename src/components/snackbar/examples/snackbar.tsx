/**
 * Basic example
 *
 * Snackbars should not necessarily require a deliberate action from the user to dismiss them.
 * This is why the component has a default `timeout` and will disappear even if the user
 * does not interact with it.
 *
 * As you see in this example, there is no `timeout` specified.
 * Therefore the snackbar will automatically disappear after a few seconds.
 *
 * :::important
 * Make sure to set a proper timeout, based on the length of the text.
 * An average user must be able to read the full message within the given
 * time!
