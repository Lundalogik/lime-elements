/**
 * Displaying a notification badge
 *
 * It is possible to display a notification badge on each individual
 * button in the Dock. Badges are supposed to inform the user that
 * there is something in the menu that requires their attention.
 *
 * This is typically done by displaying a number, which summarizes
 * the quantity of the items that require user's attention.
 *
 * :::important
 * The menus are not a part of the Dock. They are individual components
 * that you develop separately. Make sure that the information
 * and interactions regarding the notifications are correctly handled.
 *
 * For example, when the items that require user's attention are
 * seen or handled by the user after opening the menu, the badge on the
 * Dock button should disappear.
 * :::
 *
 * When this quantity is unclear or undefined, you can simply pass an
 * empty string (`badge: ''`), which will only render a circle on the button.
 * This is enough to attract user's attention.
 * However, it is also possible to use a short string such as "Â·" or "!"
 * for such cases, if considered necessary.
 *
 * :::warning
 * Do not negatively exploit this possibility and spam users' awareness.
 * The Dock is the most important and most dominant structural part of
 * the UI of your application. Therefore crowding it with too much noise
 * _will_ negatively affect the user experience.
 * :::
