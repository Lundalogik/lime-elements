/**
 * Multi-line versus single-line layout
 * By default, list items will always truncate the `text` line, which is displayed
 * either alone, or as a primary heading (when there are both `text` and `secondaryText`)
 * available. This means users will only see one line of text which is as wides as
 * the list item, and no more. Thus, it is a good idea not to add long strings of
 * text in the heading, as on mobile phones or small containers, they will be
 * chopped off and truncated.
 *
 * However, the `secondaryText` which appears as a sub-heading is not truncated
 * that quickly. By default, lists will display 3 lines of text, and then truncate
 * the rest. Nevertheless, you can increase or decrease this number by specifying
 * `maxLinesSecondaryText`.
 * :::note
 * Do not use `0`, negative numbers, decimal numbers, or very large numbers.
