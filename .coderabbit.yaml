  path_instructions:
    - path: '**/*.tsx'
      instructions: >
        Our `.tsx` files are typically using StencilJS, not React. When a
        developer wants to return multiple top-level JSX elements from the
        `render` method, they will sometimes wrap them in an array literal.
        In these cases, rather than recommending they add `key` properties to
        the elements, recommend removing the hardcoded array literal. Recommend
        wrapping the elements in StencilJS's special `<Host>` element.
    - path: '**/*.{ts,tsx}'
      instructions: >
        Imports from other files in the same module (lime-elements) must use
        relative paths. Using absolute paths for imports will cause the
        production build to fail.
    - path: '**/*.{tsx,scss}'
      instructions: >
        Almost all our components use shadow-DOM. Therefore, we have no need of
        BEM-style class names in our CSS.
    - path: 'src/components/**/examples/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
      instructions: >
        These files are an exception to the rule that all imports should use
        relative paths. When these example files import something that is
        publicly exported by lime-elements, the import should be made from
        `@limetech/lime-elements`. If they import something from another file
        inside the `example` folder, the import should use a relative path.
    - path: 'src/components/**/*.tsx'
      instructions: >
        When contributors add new props to existing components in the
        lime-elements repository, they should always add documentation examples
        that demonstrate the new prop's usage and explain how it works. This
        helps with user adoption, feature discoverability, and maintains
        comprehensive documentation.
